Bminer Nvidia CUDA Dual Miner for Equihash / Ethash / Tensority 10.3.1 (Linux/Windows)

Bminer is a high multi algo optimized miner designed to work on NVIDIA GPUs ( Maxwell and Pascal architectures with compute capability 5.0 and higher ). The optimization is due a completely restructured algorithm to maximize the stream processor occupancy and the instruction pipeline efficiency, unlocking full power from Pascal based GPUs. Currently Bminer supports Equihash based coins, Ethash based coins, Dual Mining using Ethash based coins as primary algo and Tensority based coins ( Bytom - BTM ).

Bminer also features different APIs in order to facilitate production deployments ( for example for mining farms).
It provides full SSL support connections to pools, Automatic reconnections in cases if network was down for some reasons and automatic restart if GPUs hang has been occurred.
Also do note bminer comes with 2% dev fee for Equihash based coins and Tensority based coins, 0.65% dev fee for Ethash based coins and 1.3% for dual mining mode mining the second coin without device subtraction.

The latest version release (10.3.1) includes the following optimizations , features and performance improvements:

âœ” Support all other Equihash 144.5 based coins, as well as BTG, using the equihash1445 scheme and -pers configuration
